/* I worked backwards on this one. You can see below where I used the
transform animation to first figure out what the end result needed to be.
Then I just had to insert the transforms into the end of the key frames
for the top and bottom rectangles. Then since the middle one just disappears,
I changed the color to the mediumvioletred background color.

I also wasn't sure if it was necessary to have more than two of the keyframes
for this animation. It seems to flow fine with only two.
